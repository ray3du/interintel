# Intergration Protocols
### 1. RESTful API
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architecture that outlines how two computer systems should exchange data over the internet. RESTful API's utilize HTTP requests to access and use data. REST defines GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to read, create, update, and delete records from a database.  The data formarts supported by REST API
 * application/json
 * application/xml
 * multipart/form-data

Using python3 requests module we can be able to simulate REST API basic CRUD operations.
1.	GET
```python
import requests
response = request.get("https://example.com/users")
if response.status_code == 200:
	#Convert response to json
	print(response.json())
```
2.	POST /  PUT
```python
import requests
data = { "key": "value" }

# Make post request using data
res = requests.post("http://example.com/notification")

if res.status_code == 200:
	# Print the JSON response
	print(res.json())
```
3.	DELETE
	* Delete removes a record from the database permanently.
```python
import requests

#Make delete request
res = requests.delete("http://example.com/notification?notification_id=awdesds")

if response.status_code == 200:
	print(response.json()
``` 
### 2. WebSockets 
Websocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication over a single TCP connection. Websockets allow real-time bidirectional communication between the clients and servers.

using python3  websocket module we can be able to create a client websocket connection that can connect to a websocket connection.
```python
from websocket import create_connection
import json

message = {
	"title": "",
	"message: "Hello world"
} 
# Initialize ws to contain the connection
ws = create_connection("wss://example.com/chat)

#convert message to json and send message
ws.send(json.dumps(message))	

# Depending on the usage you can close or keep the connection alive
ws.close()
```
### 3. Message Queues
This are services or data structures that stores and manages messages. They ensure that messages are delivered in the order they are received. They are a form of interprocess communication used to enable communication between different services asynchronously.  Celery is a distributed task queue that is often commbined with RabbitMQ to implement message queues as shown below.
```python
from celery import Celery

app = Celery("tasks", broker='pyamqp://guest@localhost//')

@app.task
def add(a, b):
	return a + b
```
