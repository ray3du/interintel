# Encryption / Hashing
## One-Way Hashing
### 1. MD5 (Message Digest Algorith)
* MD5 produces a 128 bit hash value from a string of any length. It represents its digest as a 32 digit hexadecimal. MD5 is however considered insecure as computers have become powerful making MD5 hashes easy to crack. Below is an example of encrypting data using MD5
```
import hashlib
text = "test"
md5 = hashlib.md5(text.encode()).hexdigest()

# Display digest string
print(md5) 
```
### 2. SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm)
* SHA-256 produces a 256 bits digest that is irreversible and thus considered a secure hashing algorithm. To keep the digest as random as possible the clear text length should be less than 264 bits.
```
import hashlib
text = "test"
sha256 = hashlib.sha256(text.encode()).hexdigest()

# Display digest string
print(sha256) 
```
## Two-way Encryption
### 1. RSA (River-Shamir-Adleman) 
RSA is the oldest and widely used two way encryption algorithm. RSA utilizes two different but linked keys. Both the private and public key can be utilized to encrypt a message. While the opposite key from the one used to encrypt the message can be used to decrypt it.
```
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_OAEP

# Generate key pair
k_pair = RSA.generate(2048)
# Encrypt the message using the public key
public_key = k_pair.publickey()
cipher = PKCS1_OAEP.new(public_key)
encrypted_text = cipher.encrypt("test".encode())

# Decrypt using private key
d_cipher = PKCS1_OAEP.new(k_pair)
decrypt_text = d_cipher.decrypt(encrypted_text).decode()
```
### 2. DES (Data Encryption Standard)
* DES Encryption utilizes a 56 bit Key to customize the transformation that is conducted in block sizes of 64 bits. This means that decryption can be done with those with the key.
```
from Crypto.Cipher import DES
from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes

# Generate 56 bit Key
key = get_random_bytes(8)
cipher = DES.new(key, DES.MODE_ECB)
text = "test"
c_text = cipher.encrypt(text.encode())

```
